## About This Project

This is a simple Todo List web application developed using vanilla JavaScript. The core logic of the app is built using JavaScript arrays and loops to manage and display the list of tasks.

- **Arrays** are used to store the list of tasks in memory.
- **Loops** are used to iterate through the array to render the tasks on the page, check for completed tasks, and handle deletions.
- Each task consists of a description and an optional due date.

The UI is minimal, allowing you to:
- Add a new task with a description and a due date.
- See all your tasks listed with their respective dates.
- Delete tasks with the click of a button.

This project is ideal for learning basic JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, array operations, and event handling.
